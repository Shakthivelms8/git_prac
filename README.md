# GitHub Jokes

1. **Why did the developer go broke?**  
   Because they used `git commit --amend` too many times and kept rewriting their history.

2. **Why do GitHub repositories never gossip?**  
   Because they always keep things in the `main` branch.

3. **I told my GitHub repo a joke…**  
   It didn’t commit.

4. **Why did the GitHub user break up with their repository?**  
   They had too many unresolved conflicts.

5. **Why is `git pull` like a bad date?**  
   Because you keep hoping it’s going to bring something nice, but it’s just full of merge conflicts.

6. **Why was the GitHub issue so good at organizing?**  
   It knew how to keep everything in order.

7. **What did the GitHub repository say to the developer?**  
   "Don’t worry, I’ve got your back. I’ll always revert to you when you need me."


   # GitHub Overview

GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration, built on Git. It allows developers to track changes, collaborate, and manage projects efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Branches**: Work on multiple features or fixes simultaneously.
- **Pull Requests**: Propose and review changes before merging.
- **Issues**: Track bugs, tasks, and enhancements.
- **Actions**: Automate workflows like testing and deployment.

## Basic Workflow
1. **Clone** a repo: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
3. **Commit** changes: `git commit -m "message"`
4. **Push** to GitHub: `git push origin <branch-name>`
